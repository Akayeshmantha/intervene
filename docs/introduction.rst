Intervene is a tool for intersection and visualization of multiple genomic region and gene sets (or lists of items).

Intervene provides an easy and automated interface for effective intersection and visualization of genomic region sets or lists of items, thus facilitating their analysis and interpretations. Intervene contains three modules.

 - `venn` to compute Venn diagrams of up-to 6 sets
 - `upset` to compute UpSet plots of multiple sets
 - `pairwise` to compute and visualize intersections of genomic sets as clustered heatmap.

Intervene gives user flexibility to choose figure colors, labels, size, quality, and type to make them as publication standard.
